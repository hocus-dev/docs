# Introduction

Hocus is a framework for creating and managing Docker development environments. Right now it is
tightly integrated with VSCode, but we hope to add support for other IDEs in the future.

Hocus is also extremely experimental right now, so you should not use it in production. Wild
breaking changes may occur at any point in time.
